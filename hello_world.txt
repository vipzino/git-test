This is my first attempt at git! 


step 1. Create the repository
step 2. move into the repos directory in the terminal - cd repos 
step 3. clone repository using the SSH - git clone <SSH Link>
step 4. move into repo using - cd <repo name> 
        display URL of the repository using - git remote -v
step 4a. create a file using the terminal with - touch <file name>
step 5. stage and commit the file using - git add <file name> and git commit -m "Any message here"
        * Add files to staging area after any changes have been made and commit *
step 6. use - git push or git push origin main to update the GitHub repo
step 7. Congrats you learned how to use git! 


Cheat Sheet

This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) 
Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

Commands related to a remote repository:

git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands related to the workflow:

git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history:

git status
git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
